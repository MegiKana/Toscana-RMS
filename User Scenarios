User Scenarios

1.Table Reservations:
-A customer opens the app, selects the "Reserve Table" option, chooses a time, and confirms the reservation. The system updates the availability and sends a confirmation email.

2.Order Management:
-A waiter inputs a customer’s order via the tablet, which is sent to the kitchen. The chef updates the order status to "In Progress" and then "Ready." The waiter gets notified and serves the dish.

3.Inventory Tracking:
-The system detects that an ingredient is below the set threshold and sends a notification to the manager to reorder. The manager views the inventory report and places a new order with the supplier.

3.Financial Reporting:
-At the end of the day, the manager generates a sales report via the system. It includes total revenue, popular menu items, and the day’s profits, which are exported as a PDF.

4.Employee Scheduling:
-The admin logs in, assigns shifts for the next week, and sends notifications to all staff. Staff can view their schedules in the app and request changes if needed.
