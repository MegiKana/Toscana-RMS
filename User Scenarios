User Scenarios

1.Table Reservations:
-A customer opens the app, selects the "Reserve Table" option, chooses a time and date, and confirms the reservation. The system updates table availability and sends a confirmation email or SMS.
-If the customer needs to modify the reservation, they can do so through the app. The system adjusts the availability and notifies staff of the update.
-The manager can view a dashboard showing current and upcoming reservations, including customer special requests.

2.Order Management:
-A waiter inputs a customer’s order via a tablet, which is sent to the kitchen system. The chef updates the order status to "In Progress" and then "Ready." The waiter receives a notification and serves the dish.
-For large group orders, the system automatically splits the order by tables or categories, ensuring accurate tracking.
-The kitchen staff can flag an issue (e.g., an unavailable ingredient), notifying the waiter to inform the customer and suggest alternatives.

3.Inventory Tracking:
-The system detects that an ingredient is below the set threshold and sends a notification to the manager to reorder. The manager views the inventory report, selects a supplier, and places a restocking order directly through the system.
-For automated inventory management, the system adjusts stock levels as orders are placed and items are used in the kitchen.
-If a critical ingredient is unavailable, the system highlights affected menu items and temporarily disables them for ordering until restocked.

4.Financial Reporting:
-At the end of the day, the manager generates a sales report that includes total revenue, popular menu items, and the day’s profits. The report can be exported as a PDF or viewed as a dashboard with charts and graphs.
-Weekly and monthly reports automatically summarize trends, helping the manager identify peak hours and high-performing staff.
-The system highlights discrepancies, such as unpaid bills or unusual payment patterns, for review.

5.Employee Scheduling:
-The admin logs in and assigns shifts for the upcoming week. Notifications are sent to staff via the app, and they can view or request changes to their schedules.
-The system suggests shift assignments based on employee availability and previous workload to prevent over-scheduling.
-Managers can use the system to track attendance and generate timesheets for payroll processing.

6.Customer Feedback and Loyalty Programs:
