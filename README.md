# Project Overview – Toscana RMS
Our project focuses on designing and analyzing a Restaurant Management System to improve efficiency in managing restaurant operations. The system will cover key aspects such as table reservations, order management, employee scheduling, inventory tracking, and financial reporting. Our goal is to create a structured and optimized workflow that ensures smooth service, cost efficiency, and customer satisfaction. 

	•	Customer Experience:
We begin with a module that tracks customer interactions—from making reservations or walking in, being seated, and placing orders. This module visually connects customers to table management and front-of-house operations.

	•	Order and Kitchen Workflow:
Orders taken by waiters are relayed to the kitchen. Our diagrams will show the flow of orders from the dining area to the kitchen, highlighting clear communication channels between staff.

	•	Inventory and Menu Control:
We will use entity-relationship diagrams to illustrate how menu items relate to ingredients and suppliers, ensuring that inventory levels are maintained and updated seamlessly.

	•	Employee Management:
Graphical representations will depict the organization of staff roles (waiters, chefs, managers) and their interactions with other modules such as order processing and reporting.

	•	Financial Reporting:
A dedicated module will display the connection between daily sales, costs, and overall revenue through simple charts and tables.

This concise visual framework ensures our system reflects the restaurant’s operational flow, providing a clear, organized picture of how all components interact to enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction.
